# C# Algorithm Practice

Welcome to the C# Algorithm Practice folder! This is a dedicated space for honing your algorithmic problem-solving skills using the C# programming language.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide you with a collection of algorithmic challenges and exercises to help you improve your problem-solving abilities. By practicing algorithms in C#, you will enhance your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and their implementation in a real-world programming language.

## How to Use

Inside this folder, you will find various subfolders, each containing different algorithmic problems. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed description, input/output examples, and a suggested solution. You are encouraged to attempt solving the problems on your own before referring to the provided solutions.

To get started, simply navigate to the desired subfolder and open the corresponding C# file. You can then read the problem statement, implement your solution, and test it against the provided test cases. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches to find the most efficient solution.

## Contributing

If you have any interesting algorithmic problems or solutions that you would like to share with the community, please feel free to contribute. Simply create a new subfolder with the problem description and your solution in C#. Don't forget to include test cases and any additional information that may be helpful.
